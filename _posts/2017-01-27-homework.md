## Submission
**All homework submissions are electronic and must be
in PDF (text) or `.ipynb` (code) format **within a `.zip` file**. Formats such as `.docx` and `.pages`
will not be accepted.**

To ensure proper grading, all homework must be submitted via email to `bi1.caltech [at] gmail [dot] com` with the following filename:

  * **`lastname_firstname_hw#.zip`** containing the files **`lastname_firstname_hw#.pdf`** or **`lastname_firstname_hw#.ipynb`** for
  problems requiring code along with any images used in the `.ipynb` file.


If you are writing your entire homework in the Jupyter notebook, you may submit the .ipynb file directly along with any images that you are embedding in the notebook (images being and pictures other than plots) in your email. In this case, you do **not** need to submit a PDF.

The subject line of your submission email must have the following format:

  * **`[Homework #] Submission of HW# for Firstname Lastname`**

For example, a submission for the first homework set would be submitted by
email with the subject line **`[Homework 1] Submission of HW1 for Barbara
McClintock`**. The attachments would be **`McClintock_Barbara_hw1.zip`** containing the files **`McClintock_Barbara_hw1.pdf`** and
**`McClintock_Barbara_hw1.ipynb`** as well as any image files used in the `.ipynb` document.

### **Any submission not abiding by this format will not be graded!**

## Regrading

If you are interested in challenging the way your homework was graded, you are limited to 2 challenges total over the term. If you ask for a regrade, your entire homework will be subjected to the same high level of scrutiny you have requested for the problem you feel has not been graded properly.  This could result in a net reduction in your grade on that particular homework if your previous graded version on other problems gets â€œoverturned". Your regrades may also be used for grading of improperly submitted homework.

To submit a regrade, email the name of the assignment you would like regraded  to `bi1.caltech [at] gmail [dot] com` with the following subject line:

`[Homework #] Homework Regrade Request for Firstname Lastname`
