Week 1 -- Migrations:
  - title: "Terrestrial animal tracking as an eye on life and planet"
    author: "Roland Kays, Margaret C. Crofoot, Walter Jetz, and Martin Wikelski."
    journal: "Science"
    year: 2015
    PDF: "Kays2015.pdf"
    description: "This very insightful article gives a wide ranging introduction to the modern state of the art in animal tracking. Every figure tells an important story."

  - title: "Estimation of forage biomass and vegetation cover in grasslands using UAV imagery"
    author: "Jérôme Théau, Étienne Lauzier-Hudon, Lydiane Aubé, and Nicolas Devillers."
    journal: "PLOS ONE"
    year: 2021
    PDF: "Theau2021.pdf"
    description: "This paper is a useful resource for thinking about the biomass of grasslands, relevant to our thinking for both the migration of wildebeest and the grazing of our cattle."

  - title: "Challenges and solutions for studying collective animal behavior in the wild"
    author: "Lacey F. Hughey, Andrew M. Hein, Ariana Strandburg-Peshkin, and Frants H. Jensen."
    journal: "Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B"
    year: 2018
    PDF: "Hughey2018.pdf"
    description: "This paper gives a very insightful overview of the technologies that are needed to study collective motions of animals."

  - title: "Distinguishing technology from biology: a critical review of the use of GPS telemetry data in ecology"
    author: "Mark Hebblewhite and Daniel T. Haydon."
    journal: "Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B"
    year: 2010
    PDF: "Hebblewhite2010.pdf"
    description: "This paper takes a critical look at the generation of “big data” associated with animal movements. Though we are incredibly enthusiastic about GPS tracking, the arguments here remind us of our own thinking on the way that DNA sequencing and structural biology have created a similar big data pressure head in the molecular interpretation of life that might be similarly misleading."
  
  - title: "From single steps to mass migration: the problem of scale in the movement ecology of the Serengeti wildebeest"
    author: "Colin J. Torney, J. Grant C. Hopcraft, Thomas A. Morrison, Iain D. Couzin, and Simon A. Levin."
    journal: "Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B"
    year: 2018
    PDF: "Torney2018.pdf"
    description: "If you are to read one paper from our list on the fascinating and inspiring topic of animal movements (and wildebeest in particular), this is it. The paper ranges from how measurements are done, to the kinds of data generated, to the kinds of models that are needed to come to terms with that data."
