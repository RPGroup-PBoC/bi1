    <h2 id="meetings-and-recitations">Meetings and Recitations</h2>
<p>Lecture occurs twice a week (Tuesdays and Thursdays) from 1:00 - 2:25 pm in 119
Kerckhoff. These sessions will involve lecture and in-class participation
including back-of-the-envelope estimations, derivations, and natural
philosophy. This course is designed to serve as an overview of some of the
overarching principles of biological inquiry and address how biology fits in
along physics, chemistry, mathematics, and engineering.</p>

<p>Recitation sessions are held once a week. These occur in the evening on
Monday’s through Thursdays and on Friday afternoons. These sessions are held
with graduate and undergraduate teaching assistants and are designed to aid you
on problem sets and further explain the topics covered in class.</p>

<p>Computational prowess is an incredibly useful skill in the modern biological
era. Many homework problems will require you to write computer programs to
execute  calculations, analyze experimental data, perform simulations, and
more. No prior computer programming experience is required for this course. The
TA’s will host computational tutorial sessions five times during the course and
will take during normal recitation times and locations. While many programming
languages are used in biology (R, C++, Java, Matlab, etc), Python will be the
language of instruction for this course. Please see the <a href="/programming">programming page</a> for instructions on setting up a scientific Python
computing environment.</p>

<h2 id="homework">Homework</h2>
<p>Homework will be assigned on Thursdays will be due the following Thursday at the beginning of class. <strong>All homework submissions are electronic and must be in PDF (text) or <code class="highlighter-rouge">.ipynb</code> (code) format. Formats such as <code class="highlighter-rouge">.docx</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">.pages</code> will not be accepted.</strong></p>

<p>To ensure proper grading, all homework must be submitted via email to <code class="highlighter-rouge">bi1.caltech [at] gmail [dot] com</code> with the following filename:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">lastname_firstname_hw#.pdf</code></strong> or <strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">lastname_firstname_hw#_prob#.ipynb</code></strong> for
  problems requiring code.</li>
</ul>

<p>The subject line of your submission email must have the following format:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">[Homework #] Submission of HW# for Firstname Lastname</code></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>For example, a submission for the first homework set would be submitted by
email with the subject line <strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">[Homework 1] Submission of HW1 for Barbara
McClintock</code></strong>. The attachments would be <strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">McClintock_Barbara_hw1.pdf</code></strong> and
<strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">McClintock_Barbara_hw1_prob3.ipynb</code></strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Any submission not abiding by this format will not be graded!</strong></p>

<h2 id="collaboration-policy-and-the-honor-code">Collaboration Policy and the Honor Code</h2>

<p>Collaboration is imperative to scientific discovery. You may work with others on your homework assignments, however <strong>all work handed in must be your own</strong>. This means that you are not allowed to hand in work copy pasted from those you worked with.</p>

<p>For programming, please follow the <a href="http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs11/material/python/collab.html">50 foot rule from
CS11</a> which
reads</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[…] If you help another student with their programming problems
(including debugging), you must not consult your own code while doing so.
Specifically, we ask that your own code be at least 50 feet away i.e. not
visible to you or the person you are helping while you are helping them. This
means that you may work with each other on programming problems but you may not
copy others code directly. […] <strong>Help them with your brain, not with your
code</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You may use resources on the internet, primary literature, or textbooks to help
you answer the questions, although you must provide a reference. You may not
use previous homework questions or solutions from previous years of this course
or other courses like it.</p>

<p>Finally, you must follow the <a href="https://www.gradoffice.caltech.edu/current/hc">Caltech honor code</a> which states</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No member of the Caltech community shall take unfair advantage of any other member of the Caltech community.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We have designed the computational sections to provide you with all of the
information you need to complete the problems described in the homework. While
you may use any of the code provided in the tutorials verbatim to solve your
homework, please do not “copy-and-paste” it directly into your notebook. We
will often use different variable names and some hard-coded numbers in the
tutorials than you will use in your homework. To make sure you understand what
each line of the code is actually doing, you should type it out by hand.</p>

<h2 id="grading-attendance-and-electronic-devices">Grading, Attendance, and Electronic Devices</h2>

<p>There will be no exams, quizzes, reports, or research proposals. The entirety
of your grade comes from completing the homework. <strong>Late homework submissions
will not be accepted without penalty</strong>. For each day a homework assignment is
late, a 10% deduction will be made from the maximum possible score. For
example, a homework received five days late will maximally earn 50%. Attendance
is expected of all students in the class. As a general rule “on time” means
that you are sitting in the class room five minutes early.</p>

<p>You may use an electronic device (e.g., tablet, laptop) to take notes during class only if you use it for this purpose. We will ask you to turn off your electronic devices or ask you to leave, if their use is off-topic or distracting to others.</p>

<h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>
<p>You may contact the course TAs through email at any time, but please do not
unnecessarily ‘spam’ them with emails.</p>

<p>The course <a href="http://piazza.com/caltech/spring2017/bi1">Piazza</a> can be used for
general questions. You may discuss homework and post public questions about
problems, topics, or things of general interest to the Bi1 students and course
staff. You may also post questions anonymously. The course TAs will monitor
this page with regularity and will respond to valid inquiries.</p>

<h2 id="absences-extensions-and-ditch-day">Absences, Extensions, and Ditch Day</h2>
<p>No absence or extension on homework will be granted without an adequate and compelling reason. All extensions require a note from a doctor or a dean</p>

<p>In the event that Ditch Day falls on the day that an assignment is due, the deadline will be extended to two calendar days later (i.e., if Ditch Day is on a Thursday when a problem set is due, then the revised due date will be Saturday at 1:00 pm). Any course meetings affected by Ditch Day will be resecheduled and posted on the <a href="/about">website home page</a>.</p>
