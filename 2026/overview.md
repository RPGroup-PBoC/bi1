# Bi 1 | The Great Ideas of Biology (2026)

_"So much of science proceeds by telling stories." --- Stephen Jay Gould_

## About
Biological processes take place across an incredible range of spatial and temporal scales, from subcellular signal transduction events ($$t \sim 10^{-9} \textrm{ s}$$, $$l \sim 10^{-10} \textrm{ m}$$) to the dynamics of whole ecosystems ($$l \sim 10^{5} \textrm{ m}$$) and the evolution of life ($$t \sim 10^{16} \textrm{ s}$$). This course is your invitation to explore the rich variety of natural phenomena underlying life on Earth. We'll tour everything from the continent-crossing migrations of whales and wildebeest to the thermodynamics of genes and cells --- with special emphasis on opportunities where quantitative tools, real data, and modern methodology can sharpen our thinking.

## Where and When?
