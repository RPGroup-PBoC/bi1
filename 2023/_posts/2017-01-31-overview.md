# Bi 1 | The Great Ideas of Biology

## About
Biological processes take place at length scales ranging from that of individual protein molecules all the way to the algal blooms or rainforests that can be seen from space, and over a dizzying nearly 30 orders of magnitude in time scales. This course will start by examining the biology of processes such as how plants and animals colonize oceanic islands, and the physics of how animals such as wildebeest form giant herds during their year-long migration. With these wonders of the living world revealed, we will then seek to understand biological phenomena by thinking about genes and cells.

## Where and When?
The course will be composed of two lecture sessions and one recitation per
week. Occasionally, there will be a computational tutorial session in lieu of
recitation.
