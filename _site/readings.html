M. Springer et al.. <em>PNAS</em> 100(21) 2003. A sudden decline in the population of Stellar sea lions in the Northern Pacific Ocean and Bering during the 1980’s took the marine conservation community by surprise. While many hypothesized the cause was due to nutritional limitation, the authors of this work describe an alternative hypothesis in which the post-war whaling industry led to a sequential megafaunal collapse, upending the fragile marine ecosystem.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rpgroup.caltech.edu/courses/bi1_2017/protected/Springer2008.pdf">Mammal-eating killer whales, industrial whaling, and the sequential megaffaunal collapse in the North Pacific Ocean: A reply to critics of Springer <i>et al.</i> 2003</a> by A. M. Springer et al.. <em>Marine Mammal Science</em> 24(2) 2008. The author 2003 paper on the megafaunal collapse in the North Pacific Ocean was met with harsh criticism and dubious claims and suspect claims of probability. In this work, the authors respond to these criticisms in a detailed manner, strengthening their claims.</p>

This fun paper by Lord Kelvin posits that the Earth is only about 20,000,000 to 400,000,000 years old due to the current temperature of the Earth. While we now know this is not correct (as he didn’t know  about convection currents and nuclear reactions), it is still an interesting view into a once controversial topic and its implication for evolution.</p>

Shubin, and Farish A. Jenkins Jr. <em>Nature</em> 440(6) 2006. While the relationship between fins and limbs has been well characterized, the origin of the major tetrapod features absent in finned aquatic organisms was a puzzle for decades. The authors discovered and described <i>Tiktaalik roseae</i>, a representative organism in the process of the fin-to-limb transition.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rpgroup.caltech.edu/courses/bi1_2017/protected/Thewissen2009.pdf">From Land to Water: the Origins of Whales, Dolphins, and Porpoises</a> by J. G. M. Thewissen et al.. <em>Evolution: Education and Outreach</em> 2 2009. While land-dwelling tetrapods arose from aquatic life, several large aquatic mammals developed from land-dwelling tetrapods venturing into the water. This paper covers the origins of dolphins, whales, and porpoises and covers the evolution of the cetacean organ system in detail.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rpgroup.caltech.edu/courses/bi1_2017/protected/McGowen2014.pdf">Molecular evolution tracks macroevolutionary transitions in Cetacea</a> by Michael R.
